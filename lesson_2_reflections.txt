What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

When you initialize a git repository there is no revision history, no commits, and thus git log returns a fatal error. You need to create the initial commit.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is a temporary container for all the files that will be changed in the repository upon commit.
