When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When you are working on a project with other people, or you work from different machines or just want a backup copy of your repo online.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Because there maybe changes in the remote that I do not want in my local repository.
